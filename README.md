📂 SPHY Engine: Audit File Structure

This directory contains the execution scripts and proof reports that demonstrate the end of uncertainty and the stabilization of Phase Determinism.

🐍 Audit Scripts (Python)

1 end_of_uncertainty_eng_sh512.py

Function: The "Singularity Trigger". This script focuses on the drastic drop in uncertainty in the initial layers. It validates the transition from Heisenberg noise to SPHY stability and generates the first SHA-512 integrity signature.

2 end_of_benchmarck_r_eng.py

Function: The Superiority Auditor. This script performs the comparative benchmark between the Hubble expansion model (classical) and the Fibonacci Geodesic (SPHY), proving deterministic superiority above 90%.

📄 Reports and Evidence (Datasets)

sphy_audit_report.csv

Complete table containing deviation metrics, expansion layers, and superiority indices calculated by the Meissner AI.

sphy_audit_report.sha512

Security digital signature of the audit report. Ensures that the proof data has not been altered post-processing.

sphy_sovereign_proof.csv

The "Sovereign Proof" dataset. Contains the raw signal recovery data where uncertainty has been neutralized by the Rust kernel.

sphy_sovereign_proof.sha512

SHA-512 integrity seal validating the Sovereign Proof as an immutable record of Phase Determinism.

How to read the results:

Execute the .py scripts to generate or update the data.

Verify the .csv files to check for mathematical accuracy.

Compare the .sha512 hashes to validate the integrity of the information.

The PHASE LOCKED status in the terminal confirms full synchronization between these files.
